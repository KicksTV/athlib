This directory contains complete Rio Olympics athletics results.

The data has been provided by Tilastopaja Oy, Finland, under 
the Open Database License.

The original file is in XML, in a format used for interchange between
Tilastopaja, Omega and DeltaTre.  It has no schema, and is not documented,
but is readable and self-explanatory.   We know that it "works" because
it contains everything needed for commentary and historical statistics.

We have written a script which transforms this into our proposed new
JSON format.  At this point, the rio*.json format is completely up for discussion.

We also have XML files day by day giving the programme.  Coming soon,
we will add the full competitor details, and background info on
some key events.
