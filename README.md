# athlib
A library of functions, data and schema for Athletics (i.e. Track and Field)

We're building lots of sites for the sport of athletics.  When we find something common and testable, we aim to place it here.   This library should contain

 - static reference data, provided it's not huge nor available elsewhere
 - Python code
 - Javascript code

 
It is NOT intended to contain web applications, view code or database code.
