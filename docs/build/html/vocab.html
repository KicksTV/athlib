<h1>Vocabulary<a class="headerlink" href="#vocabulary" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The first step towards a standard is a <cite>vocabulary</cite>.  The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)
have tools for defining these, but we&#8217;re making a start in plain English, explaining
the words we have chosen.  These will turn up as the names of records, tags and database
tables.</p>
<p>It is important to try to choose unambiguous names.   Words like <cite>event</cite> and <cite>meeting</cite> can be used in too many contexts.  Below is our first attempt, with some notes on other alteratives we considered.</p>

However, if we need to analyse of store the data unique identifiers are required.  These can be specified by an organisation, e.g <cite>otAthleteId</cite> or <cite>tpAthleteId</cite> or a combination of names, date of birth and club will often suffice.</td>

<p>During a county championships, we might have an 800m race in many age groups for men and women.  Each would be a distinct event, but they would all share an <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">eventCode</span></code> of <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">800</span></code></p>
<p>The standard should first focus on the <cite>physical</cite> events.  It&#8217;s common to run different divisions, genders and age groups together, and then separate them into <cite>logical</cite> events for scoring purposes.</p>

Different countries and even disciplines within a given country have different rules for defining agegroups.
