Introduction
============

`athlib` is an open source library of functions for Athletics (`en-US: "track and field"`) and running.
It is part of the `OpenTrack` project (http://opentrack.run/), which aims to improve systems in the sport through Open Data, Open Standards and Open Source code.  We are extremely grateful to European Athletics for their support of this initiative.

In the core library, we aim to provide 
 - standard schemas and codes for exchange of data
 - well-tested common utility functions in Python and Javascript.
 - canned data for scoring
 - introductory documentation on the project


Lots of people are building systems to manage parts of the sport.  No one system will ever do it all.  It would be a huge step forward if we could agree common interchange formats.    

We'd like to evolve agreed standards for interchange between systems.  This will hopefully involve both system-to-system standards (e.g JSON document formats), and human-friendly ones. The human-friendly ones will largely relate to what headings and values to use in spreadsheets; we can provide tools to check these and convert to JSON.

This document is not aiming for the levels of precision of an ISO or Internet standard.  In the words of the Internet Engineering Task Force, we want "rough consensus and running code".  To this end we do NOT need to agree now exactly how to represent unusual or historic events such as the six mile track record, or quibble too much about recording the exact weight of the javelin used; these are important, but we can achieve other things while these are being discussed.   We DO need to start representing the common events in the same ways.

If you disagree with the standards, join the forum (coming soon) and argue, or make counter-suggestions, so we can reach the best solution quickly.  The OpenTrack project wants to set its standards quickly.   If yu are happy to follow these standards, let us know and we'll add your name to a list to put pressure on others.
