Introduction
============

`athlib` is an open source library of functions for Athletics (en-US: "track and field") and running.
It is part of the `OpenTrack` project (http://opentrack.run/), which aims to improve systems in the sport through Open Data, Open Standards and Open Source code.

We aim to provide well-tested common utility functions in Python and Javascript.

At this time, Python is leading.  Function need to be re-done in Javascript, and we
have yet to figure out how to include `jsdoc` documentation automatically.
